# Planning poker

https://ep-planning-poker.fly.dev/

Distributed planning poker for estimating agile projects.

This web app was built using [Remix](https://remix.run/docs).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

This app uses [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for deployment. As of now, the app is manually deployed via [the Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/).
